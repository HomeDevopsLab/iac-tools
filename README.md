### Automated CI/CD
This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically:
- Builds multi-platform Docker images (amd64/arm64) on every push
- Tests all included tools (Terraform, Terragrunt, Ansible, Git)
- Performs security vulnerability scanning
- Publishes to Docker Hub on main branch and tags

See [GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md](GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md) for detailed setup instructions.
